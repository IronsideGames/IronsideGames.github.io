            <h3><a style="text-decoration: none" href="https://torontocupcake.com/contact.html">Toronto Cupcake</a></h3>
            <p>Toronto Cupcake is a website that allows you to place delivery orders for cupcakes. It showcases the
                various cupcakes they sell for certain events or just casual consumption.</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
                <li><strong>C:</strong> This website does not follow princple C. You can see various fonts and size that
                    don't match together. All links still contain their underline which would look better without it.
                    Spacing between the elements seems to vary and be very inconsistent throughout the various pages.
                    Some text seems to be very close to other blocks of elements. Many of shapes also seem badly mixed
                    together unevenly.
                </li>
                <li><strong>R:</strong> I see some repetition throughout the pages as far as color. Text size and fonts
                    seems to vary from page to page though.</li>
                <li><strong>A:</strong> I believe alignment seems to be a very big issue throughout the pages of this
                    website. Pictures and blocks of texts are often placed in spots where
                    they don't look good in. Some lines of text also seemed to be aligned incorrectly in various spots
                </li>
                <li><strong>P:</strong> One thing I notice is that the main logo at the top of website is unnecessarily
                    repeated.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3><a style="text-decoration: none" href="https://www.flyhyer.com">Hyer</a></h3>
            <p>Hyer is a private jet rental company with a website that allows users to book flights</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
                <li><strong>C:</strong> Important elements stand out throughout the website while keep less important
                    elements muted. Color and fonts keep the website looking dynamic to the eye.
                    Text blocks are correctly placed along with proper spacing and alignment.
                </li>
                <li><strong>R:</strong> Images on the website along with animations are eye catching and fits well
                    together.</li>
                <li><strong>A:</strong> Everything is aligned well and everything makes clean and clear along with a
                    sophisticated look.</li>
                <li><strong>P:</strong> Proximity seems to be no issue. Everything that relates to one another is within
                    its on block.</li>
